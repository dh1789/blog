## Get Domain + CDN + SSL in 20 Minutes

In Part 2, we created a Vultr VPS in Seoul region and completed basic security setup. Now we'll set up a **domain** for blog access, **Cloudflare CDN** for worldwide fast speed, and **HTTPS encryption** required by Google.

### Why Set Up Domain Before WordPress Installation?

1. **Save DNS Propagation Time**: DNS propagation takes 1-24 hours globally. Pre-setup enables immediate use during WordPress installation
2. **SSL Certificate Preparation**: Get SSL certificate from Cloudflare in advance for instant HTTPS application
3. **Cloudflare CDN**: Fast speed from 300+ global data centers from the start

**What You'll Learn**:
- ✅ Domain registrar comparison and why Namecheap
- ✅ Domain purchase in 4 steps ($10.98/year)
- ✅ Cloudflare free CDN + DDoS + SSL setup
- ✅ DNS nameserver change and propagation check
- ✅ DNS A record to connect VPS

**Estimated Time**: 20 minutes (+ 1-2 hours DNS propagation wait)
